# Object Detection with YOLOv5

In this project, I trained the YOLOv5 model from scratch for object detection, starting with the preparation and handling of the data. The training process was conducted using Google Colab, leveraging Google Drive as a storage solution. The V100 GPU in Google Colab was utilized to ensure efficient training. Finally, I conducted tests on both images and videos to demonstrate the capabilities of the trained model.

The model was specifically trained for the detection of the following objects:

01. Person
02. Car
03. Chair
04. Bottle
05. Sofa
06. Bicycle
07. Horse
08. Boat
09. Motor Bike
10. Cat
11. TV Monitor
12. Cow
13. Sheep
14. Aero Plane
15. Train
16. Dining Table
17. Bus
18. Potted Plan
19. Bird
20. Dog
